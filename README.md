### Project Description

SBA_3_316.

Created a small scale implementation of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Choose between 3-5 disks, 3 is the default value of disks. The goal of the game is to move the stack of disks to another location without ever placing a disk of greater width on top of a disk with a smaller width.
Game will reset after an illegal move is executed and the illegal disk is then tried to move again. Only the last submitted score is saved in local storage.
